**Run_batch_STAR_cluster.sbatch** Script to map RNA-seq data to genomes in bulk using STAR on a cluster.

**STAR_report.py** Script to obtain a tabulated file with the number and percentage of mapped reads from each sample from the STAR log files. It also works with RSEM+STAR output if intermediate files are saved.
